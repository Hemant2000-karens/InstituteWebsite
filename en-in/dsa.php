            <h1>Some points to remember about ragging</h1>
          
            <ul class="Anti-Ragging-ol">
              
              <li><b>Ragging is an act of aggression</b> committed by an individual or a group of individuals over another individual or a group of individuals where the first group, by virtue of their being senior to the second group, somehow get the authority and audacity to commit the act and the second group, by virtue of their being new to the institution are automatic victims. Any interaction which is aggressive and asymmetric (not on equal footing) is ragging.
              </li>


              <li><b>Ragging is not harmless fun.</b> In an institution like IIITDM, students come from diverse social and cultural backgrounds, and what may be harmless fun for some may turn out be serious indignity for some others. There are always a few cases where some freshers and ragging (or interaction) intolerable and suffer loss of self esteem. Nation-wide there have been more than 25 ragging deaths and suicides since 1998. It is often the case that seniors, being young students themselves, do not realize where to draw the line and when to back off – the risk is simply not worth it.
              </li>


              <li>
                <b>Ragging does not increase smartness of make a fresher bold.</b> Quite to the contrary it forces an individual to accept subjugation and conform; perhaps even rationalize it later (with the drinks and samosas at the end of the interaction period). This loss of individuality suppresses talent and reduces self-worth. In turn, the forced homogeneity precludes free flow of new ideas, creativity and the spirit of enquiry. Also, the attempt of the seniors to break the self esteem of a newcomer and revel in their shame and fear engenders feelings of bitterness and revengefulness, which is often taken out on juniors next year.
              </li>


            </ul>

            <p>Counseling is a talking therapy, a way of exploring what might help a student find his way through his current difficulties. The counseling Service believes that with support, the student is the best person to work out what right for him. We only ‘provide help’ to enable a student to find his own answers and work towards increasing his sense of competency and selfworth.</p>


            <p>Many students need the help of the counseling Service to talk about things like:</p>

            <ol class="consell" type="a"> 

              <li>Academic Problems</li>

              <li>Interpersonal Relationship</li>

              <li>Worry</li>

              <li>Feeling ‘down’ or ‘depressed'</li>

            </ol>

            <p>The counseling Service at IIITDMJ is supported by a strong team of students/Faculty/Counsellor. It is constituted by the following:- </p>


            <ol class="consell" type="1"> 
              <li>Head, counseling Service</li>
              <li>Student Coordinators</li>
              <li>Assistant Student Coordinators</li>
              <li>Student Guides</li>
              <li>Faculty Adviser</li>
              <li>Professional Counsellor</li>
              <li>Academic Helpers</li>
            </ol>



            <p>The counseling Service provides logistics in improving student’s difficulties in various ways from academic to social life. It is an integral part of the Institute that closely works with the faculty members and the administration along with the student community.</p>
