# InstituteWebsite
Website for institute,
this site is being created by me, rishav and shival.

All the things, is done by me, and some parts were made by Rishav
and Shival Only checks and suggest the things.

I made everything solely, and with my own experience, with taking helps of resources, 
but i never used any readymade or premade code from Library Like Bootstrap, Django, and all available in the markets.

Nor i will use any kind of advance framwork, or external Help. Nor Even i have seen or used any kind of w3layouts templates, or pre-build sample.


I have started creating it From October 2021, and it might be go to August of 2022, and I wish that this should be create as much as possible in great way.


Deadline given by authority is 15th July 2022, and we have to create 2-3 extra sites for this.
